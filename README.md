# micromouse

Project of a micromouse type mobile robot based on STM32 and designed PCB. Master's thesis.

## TODO LIST

- Make a serial command user interface, implement circular buffer
- Learn what is dead-time in PWM controlling
- Design wheels for 3D print and think how to make a tire with a good grip
- Learn more about encoder mode interface, using another timer in capture mode to measure speed, acceleration, deceleration. (Reference manual p. 617, fig. 169)
- Testing visual studio code
