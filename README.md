## TODO LIST

- Learn what is dead-time in PWM controlling
- Learn more about encoder mode interface, using another timer in capture mode to measure speed, acceleration, deceleration. (Reference manual p. 617, fig. 169)
- Explore CMake and TDD
- Testing visual studio code
- Change adc conversion, get mean value from 100 measurment of each channel
- ~~Design wheels for 3D print and think how to make a tire with a good grip~~
- ~~Make a serial command user interface, implement circular buffer~~
