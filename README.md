Project of a micromouse type mobile robot based on STM32 and designed PCB used as a chasis. It is my Master's Degree thesis at The Kielce University of Technology.

The simulator is created with Qt 6 libary and Qt Creator IDE. Hardware design was created with EasyEDA. Robot's software was written in C programming language in Keil uVision5 IDE.
